                                                    RECIPE OF SPRING ROLLS 
1.Soak glass noodles in room temperature water for 15 minutes, then drain. Make a few cuts with scissors. 

2. In a large saucepan or wok, fry garlic and coriander root on medium heat until the aromas are released. Becareful not to burn the garlic.

3. Turn up the heat and add all veggies, except the spring onion. Stir-fry until the bean sprouts soften slightly. Add a bit of stock to prevent it becoming too dry.

4. Add noodles, sauces and spices. Stir and blend gently until the vegetables and noodles have soaked up the sauces.

5. Turn off the heat and add the spring onion mix gently.

6. Place the spring roll wrapper with a corner towards you. Place about 4 tablespoons of the noodle mix in the middle of the wrapper. Roll it halfway until it looks like a triangle, fold in the sides, keep rolling and finally fasten the end bit of the wrapper with some ‘glue’. The roll should be around 9 cm long. Place it under the damp towel and keep rolling

7. Heat up the oil for deep-frying. The temperature should be right when it starts to form small bubbles around a tooth pick when you stick it in the oil.

 8.Slide gently 4 rolls into the pan, not too many at a time or the oil cools down and your rolls will become oily. Deep-fry until golden brown.

9. Remove from the pan and drain off excess oil.
The oil can then be reused another 3 or 4 times.
